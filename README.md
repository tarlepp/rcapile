# What is this?

Just a quick demo how to use change datetime objects output on json responses.

## Question

Someone asked help on #general channel of Symfony Slack workspace

https://symfony-devs.slack.com/archives/C3EQ7S3MJ/p1605377479004100

and after that there was this thread about that actual question

https://symfony-devs.slack.com/archives/C3EQ7S3MJ/p1605377639004800

So this repository contains simple example about that.

## Usage

Just clone this repository and start the application with `symfony serve` command.

After that just open your browser `http://localhost:8000` and you should see `Test`
entity serialized to desired format.
